## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Track Comparison
The system SHALL compare PDF tracklist durations with WAV file durations using strongly-typed Pydantic models and classify mismatches based on configurable tolerances.

#### Scenario: Perfect match
- **WHEN** PDF track duration is 240s and WAV duration is 240.1s
- **THEN** the system classifies as "OK" (within tolerance)

#### Scenario: Warning threshold
- **WHEN** difference exceeds tolerance_warn (2s) but below tolerance_fail (5s)
- **THEN** the system classifies as "WARN"

#### Scenario: Failure threshold
- **WHEN** difference exceeds tolerance_fail (5s)
- **THEN** the system classifies as "FAIL"

#### Scenario: Type-safe model handling
- **WHEN** `compare_data()` receives `TrackInfo` and `WavInfo` Pydantic models
- **THEN** the system constructs `SideResult` with model instances directly
- **AND** no dictionary conversion or type casting occurs

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Code Quality Standards
The system SHALL maintain zero unreachable code and pass strict type checking.

#### Scenario: No dead code
- **WHEN** static analysis tools scan the codebase
- **THEN** no unreachable statements are detected
- **AND** all code paths are executable

#### Scenario: Strict type checking
- **WHEN** mypy runs with --strict flag
- **THEN** all type annotations are valid
- **AND** no type: ignore comments are needed for core domain logic
